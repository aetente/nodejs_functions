# nodejs_functions
just a short task for two function where one finds same metrics for filters

and other is merging objects

----

The results you can see in console, or where you started the server, but it just won't look pretty

----

you can use your own metrics and identitites files with arguments

first one would be the metrics file, the other is identities
